title: "About Me"
---

  
I am a professional software engineer experienced in building software for diverse engineering sectors such as aviation, automotive, & energy. My day-to-day work involves develoment, maintenance and support of design & analysis tools for engineers. My academic training is in mechanical and aerospace engineering. I also hold a post graduate diploma in software development. Working across transverse domains has led me to approach problems solving through a "system + first-principle" thinking.
