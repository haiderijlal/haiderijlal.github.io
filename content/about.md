title: "About Me"
---

  
I am a professional software engineer experienced in building software for diverse sector such as aviation, automotive, & energy. My academic training is in mechanical and aerospace engineering. Working across interdisciplinary domains has led me to approach problems through a system + first-principle thinking. Lately, I have been learning computer science more formally through books and online courses, with a focus on computer systems, computer architecture & artificial intelligence.
